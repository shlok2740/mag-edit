  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Glamour Filter. Create a soft shimmer, feminine glow aesthetic with refined beauty lighting for flattery, and warm polished luminance typical of Glamour magazine, emphasizing romantic allure and radiance. The overall atmosphere should be inviting and glowing, reminiscent of beauty-focused spreads. Style objects with glowing skin-like highlight mapping for realism, soft shimmer overlay for sparkle, warm glossy edges for smoothness, and delicate feminine finish for grace. Set the background as champagne for luxury, blush for romance, ivory for purity, with soft-focus glamour gradients for diffusion. Apply lighting with warm beauty lighting for evenness, gentle diffusion for softness, radiant highlights for emphasis, and warm golden-pink bounce for warmth. Emphasize aesthetics including polished elements for refinement, feminine touches for appeal, glowing effects for luminosity, and romantic glamour for emotion. Include photographic characteristics such as shallow depth of field for intimacy, smooth bokeh for backgrounds, an 85mm beauty lens for focus, and soft yet radiant detail for balance. The style medium should be Glamour-style beauty editorial photography, capturing empowering imagery. Only add text if the user explicitly asks, in soft, glowing tones. The context should align with Glamour magazine beauty/lifestyle editorial, focusing on relatable glamour. The artistic style is radiant, polished, glowing, and soft, prioritizing feminine warmth. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
