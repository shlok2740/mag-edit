  "prompt": "A bold, cool-toned editorial portrait inspired by the aesthetic of GQ magazine. The image features a clean, minimalist male fashion composition with moderate depth of field, maintaining crisp focus on the subject while introducing a slight blur to the background. The background consists of a simple, unembellished studio backdrop in cool grey or steel-blue tones with very subtle texture, reinforcing a modern, masculine editorial environment. The lighting employs high-contrast directional illumination positioned as a 45-degree spotlight originating from the upper right. This creates sharp, well-defined shadows that emphasize the structural elements of the subject, including the jawline, cheekbones, and contours of tailored clothing, resulting in a powerful and sculpted appearance. The color palette is dominated by cool tones such as greys, metallic blues, and deep charcoal blacks, establishing a mood that is strong, bold, confident, and distinctly modern. The photographic characteristics include very sharp focus with pronounced edge clarity and high contrast throughout the image. The composition utilizes a slightly low camera angle to convey a sense of dominance and authority, captured with a lens focal length between 70mm and 135mm to produce a flattering yet commanding perspective. The overall aesthetic is characterized by crisp, high-contrast photography that prioritizes structure, minimalism, and visual precision. The combination of directional lighting with sharp shadows, a restrained cool-toned palette, and meticulous focus creates a powerful editorial portrait that embodies the sophisticated, masculine energy typically associated with male fashion photography featured in GQ magazine."
