  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a GQ Sharp Filter. Create a cool-toned, bold, masculine editorial look with strong clarity and definition, crisp shadows that add depth and structure, steel-blue undertones for a sophisticated edge, and high fashion minimalism typical of GQ men's portraits, emphasizing confidence and modern masculinity. The overall atmosphere should be assertive and refined, evoking the sharp, professional vibe of men's fashion editorials. Keep all objects unchanged in form but adapt them with sharper edges for precision, cooler temperatures to convey a sleek detachment, defined contours that highlight shapes and forms, higher contrast textures for tactile emphasis, and subtle steel-blue reflective tones for a metallic coolness. Set the background as cool grey for neutrality, steel blue for a moody undertone, with a minimalist matte backdrop to avoid distractions, and allow slight grain or subtle texture for added realism without overwhelming. Apply lighting with a strong 45° spotlight for directional intensity, high contrast to create dramatic play between light and dark, hard jawline shadows for chiseled features, a cool white/blue cast to enhance the tonal palette, and defined light falloff for controlled transitions. Emphasize aesthetics including clean, bold, masculine elements for strength, high clarity for sharpness throughout, editorial confidence that exudes authority, and a monochrome or cool palette for understated elegance. Include photographic characteristics such as moderate depth of field to balance focus and context, strong edge clarity for crisp details, a slight low angle for an authoritative presence, a 70–135mm telephoto portrait feel for compression and intimacy, and minimal noise for a clean finish. The style medium should be high-contrast male editorial photography, capturing the essence of powerful, styled portraits. Only add text when the main prompt explicitly asks, rendering it to fit the cool, sharp aesthetic. The context should align with men’s fashion editorial similar to GQ, focusing on contemporary style and poise. The artistic style is crisp, cool, modern, and confident, prioritizing boldness and precision. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
