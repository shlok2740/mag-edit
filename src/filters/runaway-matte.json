  "prompt": "A cinematic, high-contrast editorial portrait inspired by the intense atmosphere of New York Fashion Week backstage photography. The image features a runway or backstage composition with a medium depth of field that sharply emphasizes the face while allowing the edges to gradually fade. The background consists of a dark matte charcoal or black backdrop with a subtle vignette, replicating the raw, focused environment of backstage areas and eliminating visual distractions. The lighting employs dramatic, directional runway illumination delivered through a strong top spotlight with minimal fill light. This creates deep, pronounced shadows that establish a powerful sense of fashion drama and sculptural definition, emphasizing the subject's form and facial structure with striking intensity. The color palette is dominated by matte black, charcoal neutrals, and pervasive deep shadows, cultivating an atmosphere that is intense, bold, cinematic, and distinctly high-fashion. The photographic characteristics include sharp edge definition paired with a matte contrast finish, producing a textured, unpolished quality that maintains clarity while avoiding glossy or reflective surfaces. The composition utilizes an eye-level runway camera angle captured with a telephoto lens focal length between 70mm and 200mm, creating a focused and slightly compressed perspective that enhances the subject's commanding presence. The overall aesthetic embodies the raw, dramatic energy of fashion runway photography, characterized by its matte surface quality, extreme tonal contrast, and theatrical lighting. The combination of strong top lighting with deep, enveloping shadows, a dark matte backdrop, and precise edge focus creates a powerful visual narrative that captures the immediacy, intensity, and high-stakes atmosphere of backstage photography during major fashion events."
