  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Runway Matte Filter. Create a cinematic matte, dark, intense runway lighting aesthetic with harsh spotlights for drama, and matte blacks for depth, typical of backstage fashion scenes, emphasizing tension and high-stakes glamour. The overall atmosphere should be moody and immersive, reminiscent of fashion week intensity. Render objects with matte textures to reduce shine, deep shadows for mystery, high silhouette contrast for bold outlines, and reduced glossiness for a grounded feel. Set the background as charcoal black for absorption, matte vignette for focused framing, and low visibility environment for atmospheric enclosure. Apply lighting with harsh top spotlight for overhead drama, strong directional shadows for sculpting, cinematic contrast for visual punch, and runway-like ambiance for event energy. Emphasize aesthetics including dramatic elements for impact, high-fashion sophistication, heavy contrast for intensity, and backstage runway mood for behind-the-scenes vibe. Include photographic characteristics such as medium depth of field for contextual detail, crisp matte detail for texture emphasis, eye-level runway perspective for immersion, and a 70–200mm lens feeling for versatile zoom. The style medium should be cinematic matte photography, capturing film-like quality. Only add text when explicitly asked, ensuring it fits the matte, dark scheme. The context should align with runway/backstage editorial, focusing on fashion dynamics. The artistic style is matte, dramatic, and intense, prioritizing contrast and mood. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
