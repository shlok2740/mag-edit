  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of an InStyle Filter. Create a bright, modern lifestyle fashion aesthetic with natural warmth for approachability, clean edges for precision, and approachable editorial brightness, emphasizing contemporary relatability. The overall atmosphere should be fresh and inviting, reminiscent of lifestyle magazines. Style objects with soft, fresh glow for vitality, modern clean lines for simplicity, natural tones for authenticity, and subtle lifestyle warmth for comfort. Set the background as soft daylight neutrals, cream for softness, tan for earthiness, with clean lifestyle studio backdrops for minimalism. Apply lighting with bright daylight for energy, mild diffusion for evenness, low contrast for naturalness, and natural skin-friendly cast for realism. Emphasize aesthetics including modern elements for currency, warm tones for welcoming, relatable vibes for connection, and lightweight fashion tone for ease. Include photographic characteristics such as moderate depth of field for balance, clean edge clarity for sharpness, 35–50mm lifestyle lens for wide perspective, and natural exposure for true-to-life feel. The style medium should be lifestyle fashion photography, capturing everyday elegance. Only add text when explicitly requested, in clean, modern fonts. The context should align with InStyle magazine lifestyle/fashion editorial, focusing on accessible style. The artistic style is fresh, modern, clean, and warm, prioritizing brightness and relatability. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
