  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Harper Luxe Filter. Create a warm, golden luxury aesthetic with champagne tones for richness, elegant highlights for sophistication, and old-money visual richness, emphasizing timeless opulence and refinement. The overall atmosphere should be indulgent and warm, reminiscent of high-society editorials. Style objects with warm refined glow for allure, rich textures for depth, smooth premium finish for quality, and champagne warmth for golden hues. Set the background as champagne-gold gradients with smooth warm transitions for fluidity, and subtle luxury gloss for understated shine. Apply lighting with warm side fill for balanced illumination, gold-toned highlights for accents, gentle roll-off for soft fading, and premium editorial warmth for cozy elegance. Emphasize aesthetics including a rich golden palette for wealth, elegant and refined composition, and luxury editorial feeling for high-end appeal. Include photographic characteristics such as shallow depth of field for focus, soft bokeh for creamy backgrounds, premium portrait clarity for detail, and an 85mm portrait lens for intimate compression. The style medium should be luxury editorial photography, capturing aspirational imagery. Only add text if explicitly required, in warm, elegant tones. The context should align with Harper’s Bazaar luxury vibes, focusing on sophisticated lifestyles. The artistic style is warm, refined, and opulent, prioritizing golden luxury. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
