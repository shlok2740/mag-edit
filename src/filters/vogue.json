  "prompt": "A bright, luxurious high-fashion portrait inspired by the aesthetic of Vogue magazine. The image features a centered high-fashion composition with a shallow depth of field, maintaining precise focus on the subject while softly blurring the background. The background consists of an elegant off-white or platinum-toned gradient studio backdrop with smooth, seamless transitions, embodying the refined minimalism characteristic of Vogue's editorial photography. The lighting employs luxury softbox illumination with extensive diffusion, delivered through even frontal placement supplemented by gentle top-fill. This creates very subtle, clean shadows with premium fall-off that smooth the skin while preserving defined contours, eliminating harshness and maintaining a flawless, polished appearance. The color palette is dominated by crisp whites, platinum tones, and neutral beiges, cultivating an atmosphere of luxury, refinement, and timeless elegance. The photographic characteristics emphasize super clean, high-refinement detail, particularly in skin texture and clothing surfaces, with meticulous clarity and flawless tonal transitions. The composition utilizes a straight-on fashion portrait camera angle captured with a portrait lens focal length between 50mm and 85mm, producing a natural and authoritative perspective that places complete focus on the subject. The overall aesthetic is characterized by bright, pristine minimalism where clean whites, premium highlights, and subtle definition combine to create an impression of effortless sophistication. The combination of extensively diffused luxury lighting, a neutral and unobtrusive backdrop, and precise, high-fidelity focus results in a highly refined photograph that exemplifies the polished, editorial perfection typically associated with Vogue's high-fashion imagery, making it ideal for luxury branding, model headshots, and premium editorial presentations."
