  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Vogue Platinum Filter. Create a high-fashion luxury aesthetic with bright platinum-white tones dominating the scene, ultra-clean highlights for pristine illumination, smooth premium surfaces that exude quality, and minimalistic elegance inspired by Vogue, emphasizing sophistication and timeless refinement. The overall atmosphere should be opulent yet understated, reminiscent of elite fashion editorials. Render objects to appear refined with meticulous detail, high-end in material and finish, smooth and minimalistic to eliminate clutter, and subtly glossy with premium tonality for a luxurious sheen. Set the background as a platinum or off-white gradient with soft transitions for seamless blending, pure high-key minimalism to maintain brightness, and low texture for a clean, unadorned look. Apply lighting with full softbox diffusion for even coverage, premium white highlights to accentuate key areas, clean and professional shadowing for subtle depth, and bright, controlled exposure to avoid overblown areas. Emphasize aesthetics including ultra-minimalist composition for focus on essentials, high-fashion elements for couture vibes, clean luxury tones for elegance, and platinum/white dominance for a bright, airy palette. Include photographic characteristics such as shallow depth of field to isolate luxury elements, straight-on angle for direct engagement, smooth clarity for flawless detail, and a 50–85mm portrait lens for balanced perspective. The style medium should be high-fashion photography, capturing the pinnacle of editorial excellence. Only add text upon explicit instruction, ensuring it blends seamlessly. The context should align with classic Vogue high-fashion editorial, promoting aspirational luxury. The artistic style is bright, refined, luxurious, and pristine, prioritizing purity and high-end appeal. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
