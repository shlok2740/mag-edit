  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of an Elle Soft Editorial Filter. Create a dreamy and airy feminine pastel aesthetic with pink, lilac, and cream hues blending softly, featuring gentle haze for ethereal softness, and soft transitions reminiscent of Elle beauty spreads, emphasizing delicacy and romantic femininity. The overall atmosphere should be light and whimsical, evoking a sense of graceful beauty. Style objects with soft pastel bloom for a diffused glow, gentle blurred transitions for seamless integration, smooth and delicate textures for tactility, and feminine luminescence for an inner light effect. Set the background as pastel gradients of pink for sweetness, lilac for subtle mystery, cream for neutrality, with airy fog-like diffusion for a hazy, dreamlike quality. Apply lighting with very diffused daylight for natural softness, almost no shadows to maintain evenness, hazy glow for atmospheric depth, and pastel-tinted highlights for color-infused warmth. Emphasize aesthetics including ethereal elements for otherworldliness, feminine touches for softness, soft-focus beauty for gentle appeal, and pastel editorial tones for harmonious coloring. Include photographic characteristics such as very shallow depth of field for intimate focus, soft drop-off at edges for vignette-like fading, a 50mm beauty lens for natural perspective, and smooth pastel haze for overall diffusion. The style medium should be soft-focus beauty editorial, capturing tender, magazine-style imagery. Only add text if explicitly requested, rendering it in soft, blended tones. The context should align with Elle fashion/beauty editorial, focusing on accessible elegance. The artistic style is pastel, airy, gentle, and elegant, prioritizing softness and dreaminess. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
