  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a W Magazine Filter. Create an avant-garde, high-art couture aesthetic with bold contrasts for impact, experimental shapes for innovation, unconventional framing for surprise, and museum-like high fashion, emphasizing creativity and abstraction. The overall atmosphere should be conceptual and artistic, reminiscent of cutting-edge editorials. Style objects as elongated for dramatic proportion, hyper-stylized for exaggeration, sculptural for three-dimensionality, editorially abstract for interpretation, bold in contrast for visual strength, and exaggerated in perspective for distortion. Set the background as monochrome or bold saturated color field for focus, art-gallery minimalism for space, and clean geometric framing for structure. Apply lighting with harsh sculptural directional key light for shaping, strong artistic shadows for depth, high contrast shaping for form, and intentional dramatic interplay for tension. Emphasize aesthetics including experimental elements for novelty, conceptual fashion for ideas, artistic negative space for balance, and high-end avant-garde editorial for sophistication. Include photographic characteristics such as deep contrast for drama, off-axis camera angles for uniqueness, unexpected cropping for intrigue, and 35–70mm conceptual lens style for versatility. The style medium should be high-art conceptual fashion photography, capturing gallery-worthy shots. Only add text if the prompt includes it, in bold, abstract forms. The context should align with W Magazine avant-garde editorial compositions, focusing on artistic expression. The artistic style is bold, sculptural, experimental, and artistic, prioritizing innovation. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
