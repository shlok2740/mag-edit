  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Cosmopolitan Glow Filter. Create a warm, glowing, feminine editorial look featuring rich rose-gold and peach undertones, luminous and radiant highlights that emphasize natural beauty, soft and seamless warm color transitions for a harmonious flow, and polished beauty aesthetics with an emphasis on elegance and refinement. The overall atmosphere should be glamorous yet approachable, evoking a sense of radiant confidence reminiscent of modern Cosmopolitan magazine beauty spreads, with a focus on empowering femininity and subtle allure. Incorporate all objects styled with warm, peach-infused highlights that add a sun-kissed warmth, soft glowy edges for a dreamy ethereal quality, warm reflective sheen that mimics golden hour light, subtly smoothed surfaces to eliminate imperfections while retaining realism, gently diffused transitions between elements for a blended softness, and elevated feminine luminance that makes subjects appear illuminated from within. Ensure textures appear softer, warmer, and subtly radiant, as if bathed in a gentle, flattering light that enhances their appeal without overpowering. Set the background as a smooth gradient incorporating shades of peach for a fresh vibrancy, blush pink for a romantic touch, rose-gold for luxurious metallic hints, and soft beige for neutral balance; the gradients must be low-contrast to avoid harshness, warm in tone to complement the subject, and editorial in style for a professional, magazine-ready feel. Apply lighting with beauty-focused frontal soft light to evenly illuminate the face or main subject, gentle overhead glow for a halo-like effect, feathered shadows that fade softly without definition, a warm cast in peach-gold hues to infuse coziness, very soft edges with almost no hard shadows for a flattering diffusion, and uniform radiance on the subject to create an even, glowing presence. Emphasize aesthetics including a warm complementary palette that pairs colors harmoniously, feminine editorial polish for a high-end refined look, soft glamour that feels luxurious yet accessible, high preference and aesthetic scores implying visual perfection, and a balanced, centered beauty composition that draws the eye symmetrically to the focal point. Include photographic characteristics such as a very shallow depth of field to isolate the subject dramatically, soft yet precise facial or subject highlights for targeted glow, a slightly overhead eye-level camera angle for an intimate yet empowering perspective, a 50–85mm portrait lens effect for natural compression and focus, and smooth bokeh in the background for creamy out-of-focus areas. The style medium should be polished beauty editorial photography, capturing the essence of high-quality magazine shoots. Only add text if explicitly prompted in the main request, and if so, render it in warm, glossy tones with soft glow edges and modern editorial fonts for a sophisticated integration. The context should align with a beauty or lifestyle editorial similar to Cosmopolitan magazine, promoting aspirational yet relatable imagery. The artistic style is glowing, warm, feminine, soft, polished, and radiant, prioritizing emotional warmth and visual harmony. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
