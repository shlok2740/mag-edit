  "prompt": "This description outlines a beauty editorial filter inspired by the aesthetic of Cosmopolitan magazine, emphasizing a warm, glamorous portrayal of femininity. The filter creates a polished beauty portrait characterized by a soft, glowing quality, with enhanced skin radiance, subtle warmth, and a luminous finish. The background consists of a smooth, distraction-free gradient that seamlessly blends warm peach, rose-gold, and light beige tones, simulating the controlled environment of a professional beauty photography studio. The lighting is soft and radiant, delivered primarily from the front with a gentle fill from overhead. Shadows are minimal and delicately feathered, providing just enough definition to subtly sculpt the cheekbones and facial contours while maintaining an overall luminous appearance.Visually, the composition centers on a close-up beauty portrait captured at eye level, employing a shallow depth of field to keep the face in crisp focus while gently blurring the background. The focal point is sharply defined on the eyes and lips, with the skin texture receiving a soft, flattering enhancement. The color palette is dominated by warm tones—peach, rose-gold, and caramel highlights—infused with subtle golden undertones, cultivating a mood that is glamorous, confident, and distinctly feminine. Photographically, the style emulates a traditional portrait lens, utilizing a focal length between 50mm and 85mm to produce a natural and flattering perspective. The overall effect is a highly polished, warm, glow-enhanced editorial photograph, specifically tailored to accentuate the vibrancy and refined femininity of the subject, making it particularly suited for portraiture and makeup-focused imagery."
