  "prompt": "Generate a highly detailed image in the style of a Vanity Fair Filter. Create a classic Hollywood-inspired, cinematic portrait lighting aesthetic with luxurious depth for immersion, rich tones for vibrancy, and dramatic elegance, emphasizing timeless celebrity appeal. The overall atmosphere should be sophisticated and narrative, reminiscent of iconic photoshoots. Style objects with refined contours for definition, subtle gloss for shine, deep rich shadows for mood, and elegant Hollywood tonality for nostalgia. Set the background as jewel-tone backdrops including deep burgundy for passion, navy for depth, emerald for luxury, and champagne neutral tones for balance. Apply lighting with classic Hollywood key light for focus, soft shadow fall-off for grace, subtle dramatic depth for dimension, and controlled highlights for precision. Emphasize aesthetics including timeless elements for endurance, dramatic flair for impact, elegant composition for poise, and celebrity-style portrait for star quality. Include photographic characteristics such as medium-shallow depth of field for context, clean cinematic definition for clarity, 85–135mm portrait lens for compression, and subtle grain allowed for film-like texture. The style medium should be cinematic Hollywood editorial portrait photography, capturing story-driven images. Only add text if explicitly requested, in elegant, classic fonts. The context should align with Vanity Fair celebrity-style photoshoots, focusing on glamour and persona. The artistic style is elegant, dramatic, cinematic, and timeless, prioritizing depth and sophistication. But in any case, the original facial structure—including all specific facial features, proportions, and morphology—must remain completely unchanged. The original body structure—including pose, proportions, skeletal framework, and silhouette—must be preserved without any alteration, reshaping, or modification. All existing clothing must remain exactly as presented in the original reference, without changing the garments themselves, their fit, fabric appearance, style, or placement. The specified filter should be applied solely through modifications to lighting, tonal balance, surface rendering characteristics, textural quality, highlight and shadow placement, and background composition, without any deformation, replacement, or restructuring of the subject's face, body, or wardrobe."
